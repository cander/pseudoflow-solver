<h1>Pseudoflow Solver Software</h1></center>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
In this directory, you will find the source code for an implementation
of the pseudoflow algorithm for maximum flow.&nbsp; In addition to the
C++ code that is compiled into the solver programs, there is also a
<a href="http://www.literateprogramming.com/"><i>Literate Program</i></a> 
which explains in great detail how it all works.
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
Prerequisites</h2>
The code is built with the following tools:
<ul>
<li>
g++: This compiles under versions 2.7-2.9 of g++ on FreeBSD, Solaris, and
Cygwin.</li>

<li>
gmake - other make tools may work, but I've only used gmake</li>

<li>
noweb: The code is written using the 
<a href="http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~nr/noweb/">noweb</a> 
literate programming tool.&nbsp;
The distirbution contains up-to-date C++ source files, so if you just want
to compile and run the programs, you can do so without noweb.&nbsp; Likewise,
the Latex and PostScript is up-to-date, so you don't need to build them
from the sources via noweb.</li>

<li>
latex: To format the literate program documentation</li>
</ul>

<h2>
Installation Instructions</h2>
After extracting the files from the tar-archive, gmake will build the binaries.&nbsp;
Edit <tt>site.mk</tt> to adjust the compile flags as needed as explained in the
file.&nbsp; Some of the available make targets are:
<ul>
<li>
default/all: build all the programs with debugging enabled</li>

<li>
optimize: build the programs without debugging and with compiler optimizations
enabled</li>

<li>
doc.dvi: build the literate program version of the Latex code</li>
</ul>
The programs that get built are:
<ul>
<li>
llps - the basic solver for single instances of the max-flow problem.</li>

<li>
pllps - the parametric solver for parametric max-flow problems</li>

<li>
gpps - the warm-start solver for non-parametric sequences of problems.</li>
</ul>

<h2>
Running the programs</h2>
The programs all accept arguments in the same basic format:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <tt>program [options] input-file(s) output-file</tt>
<br>Invoking the programs without arguments will cause a usage message
to be printed which explains all of the aviailible options.
